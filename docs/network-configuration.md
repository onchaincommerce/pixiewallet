# Super Wallet: Network Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to configure and use different blockchain networks with Super Wallet.

## Supported Networks

Super Wallet currently supports the following networks:

| Network | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Ethereum Mainnet | Production | The primary Ethereum blockchain network |
| Ethereum Goerli | Testnet | Ethereum test network for development |
| Base Mainnet | Production | An Ethereum L2 scaling solution by Coinbase |
| Base Goerli | Testnet | Test network for Base |

## Switching Networks

1. Open the Super Wallet application
2. Click on the network selector in the top navigation bar
3. Select your desired network from the dropdown menu
4. Wait for the network connection to be established

The application will remember your last selected network when you reopen it.

## Network-Specific Considerations

### Ethereum Mainnet
- Uses real ETH with real value
- Higher transaction fees, especially during network congestion
- Recommended for production use and real-value transactions
- Requires a funded account with real ETH

### Ethereum Goerli
- Uses test ETH (no real value)
- Lower transaction fees
- Ideal for development and testing
- Get test ETH from [Goerli Faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/)

### Base Mainnet
- Uses real ETH with real value
- Faster transactions and lower fees than Ethereum Mainnet
- Built on Optimistic Rollup technology
- Requires bridging ETH from Ethereum Mainnet

### Base Goerli
- Uses test ETH (no real value)
- Fast and low-cost test environment
- Ideal for testing Base-specific functionality
- Get test ETH from [Base Goerli Faucet](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet)

## Adding Custom Networks

Super Wallet allows you to add custom EVM-compatible networks:

1. Click on the network selector in the top navigation bar
2. Select "Add Network" at the bottom of the dropdown
3. Fill in the network details:
   - Network Name: A display name for the network
   - RPC URL: The network's JSON-RPC endpoint
   - Chain ID: The network's unique identifier
   - Currency Symbol: The native token symbol (e.g., ETH)
   - Block Explorer URL: URL to view transactions (optional)
4. Click "Save" to add the network

## Network Connection Troubleshooting

If you experience network connection issues:

1. Verify your internet connection
2. Check if the selected network is operational
3. For custom networks, verify your RPC URL is correct
4. Try switching to a different network and back
5. Reload the application if problems persist

## Gas Fees & Network Settings

### Gas Fee Preferences

Super Wallet allows you to configure gas fee preferences:

1. Go to Settings > Transaction Settings
2. Select your preferred gas price strategy:
   - **Economical**: Slower but cheaper transactions
   - **Standard**: Balanced speed and cost
   - **Fast**: Quicker transactions with higher fees

### Transaction Speed vs. Cost

- **Mainnet networks**: During high congestion, fees can increase significantly. Consider using economical settings for non-urgent transactions.
- **Testnet networks**: Fees are minimal, so the "Fast" setting is usually appropriate.

## Smart Contract Deployment Considerations

When deploying smart wallets:

- **Testnet First**: Always deploy and test on testnets before using production networks
- **Gas Limits**: Smart wallet deployment requires more gas than regular transactions
- **Deployment Time**: Can vary from seconds to minutes depending on network congestion
- **Owner Account**: Must have sufficient funds to cover the deployment gas cost

## Bridge Configuration

To move assets between different networks (e.g., Ethereum to Base):

1. Go to the Bridge tab in the application
2. Select source and destination networks
3. Enter the amount to bridge
4. Review the transaction details and fees
5. Confirm the transaction

Note that bridging between networks typically involves a waiting period for security purposes.

## Advanced Network Settings

Advanced users can customize RPC endpoints and other network parameters:

1. Go to Settings > Network Settings
2. Select the network you want to customize
3. Modify the network parameters as needed
4. Click "Save" to apply changes

## Security Considerations

- Always verify you're on the correct network before sending transactions
- Use testnets for testing and experimentation
- Be cautious of high-value transactions on mainnet networks
- Consider using hardware wallets for additional security on production networks
